# osu!skillpicker (WIP)

Tampermonkey script for [osu!](osu.ppy.sh) which provides the ability to mark, search and view skillsets for all beatmaps.

# Overview

**osu!skillpicker** is Tampermonkey script for [osu!](osu.ppy.sh) that allows you to choose how much of a beatmap corresponds to a certain skillset. This can be useful both for casual players who want to find out what a beatmap is, and for e.g. people who make mappools of beatmaps for tournaments. 

This is an expiremental project that is still under development, in the future, we may use the data for ML. Even if you are not a person who will use the extension often, you can still help the project and cast votes for different beatmaps to help collecting data.
